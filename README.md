# ESLint example

This is a very simple project set up to be linted with the [AirBnb profile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb).

Use this as an template for how to configure ESLint yourself.

Some key files to check out:

- `package.json` has ESLint and the AirBnb profile as `devDependencies`.
- `.eslintrc.json` configures ESLint for this project.

## Trying it out yourself

```
# Get a copy of this project locally.
git clone <this-repo>
cd eslint-example

# Install the project's dependencies.
npm install

# Run ESLint on this project.
npm run lint
```
